# HW3-Password-Generator

For HW3 we were asked to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app needed to be able to run in the browser and it needed to feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It also needed to feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

**The accepted Criteria for HW3 is as follows:**
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
